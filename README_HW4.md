Homework 4
I had a very productive discussion with Ramiz Qudsi.

Ramiz helped with finding the O(N log(N)) package to calculate POC.

I had a very useful discussion with Dr. Bianco regarding concept of qi in calculating likelihood of a point coming from line or gaussian noise. 
She also helped me understand / identify suspicious distribution in marginal plots.  
Thanks.
