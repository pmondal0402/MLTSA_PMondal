Homework 6
I had a very productive discussion with Adam clarifying doubts about classifier and clustering.
I also had an informative discussion with ramiz about calculating distance metric using braycurtis method.
I am also very thankful for necessary hints provided by Dr. Bianco in class and on slack.
Thanks.
